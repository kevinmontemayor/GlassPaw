GlassPaw is a SwiftUI iOS 26 showcase app exploring the all-new Liquid Glass effects introduced in iOS 26. Designed with playful elegance, this app uses SF Symbols, matched geometry transitions, and dynamic visual states to demonstrate how Apple’s latest glassEffect, glassEffectID, and glassEffectTransition APIs can be applied across interactive components.
Key features:
* Liquid Glass Containers with matched geometries and animated transitions
* Pawprint-themed Navigation Toolbar, expanding from the corner with custom animation
*  Modular Sections for experimenting with magnification, glass unions, identifiers, and more
* Beautiful adaptive backgrounds that change with the system’s color scheme
* Full SwiftUI-native architecture leveraging the new iOS 26 APIs
Ideal for developers exploring Liquid Glass UI, matched transitions, or just building delightfully animated SwiftUI apps.
